This is a simple and silly bluffing game for 
two human players. Each player has a box. 
One box has a carrot in it, and each player 
wants to have the carrot. The first player looks 
in their box and then tells the second player they 
either do or donâ€™t have the carrot. The second player 
gets to decide whether to swap boxes or not.
