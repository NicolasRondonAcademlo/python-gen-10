The Caesar cipher is an ancient encryption algorithm used by Julius Caesar. 
It encrypts letters by shifting them over by a 
certain number of places in the alphabet. We 
call the length of shift the key. For example, if the 
key is 3, then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes 
F, and so on. To decrypt the message, you must shift 
the encrypted letters in the opposite direction. This 
program lets the user encrypt and decrypt messages 
according to this algorithm.
